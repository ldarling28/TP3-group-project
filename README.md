# Branches, not Forks!

It seems the appropriate way to use GitHub is to use Branches, rather than the Forks we've been using so far. 
I've created a branch for each of us, and added the framework for the final application to the Mater branch.
Upload code you're working on to your personal branch, and when you have completed functions or code that you'd like to add to the main project, make a "pull request" and I'll add it to the Master branch.

Thanks,
Max
