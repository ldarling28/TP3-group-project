The framework for the applicaton is now set up.

The board is represented by a 2-dimensioanal vector of tuples containing doubles and booleans:
 
  std::vector<std::vector<std::tuple<double,bool>>>;
  
TODO:
- Write a function that initialises a board from a BitMap image
- Write functions for faster algorithms than the Jacobi method.
- Implement convergence detection
